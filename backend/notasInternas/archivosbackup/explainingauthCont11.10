Your authController is responsible for managing user authentication and handling various authentication-related tasks in your Express application. Let's break down each part of the controller:

    Middleware to Check if the User is Authenticated (isLoggedIn):
        This middleware function (isLoggedIn) checks if the user is authenticated using req.isAuthenticated().
        If the user is authenticated, it calls the next() function to continue to the next middleware or route.
        If the user is not authenticated, it sends a status code 401 (Unauthorized).

    Google Authentication Middleware (authenticateGoogle):
        This middleware is used for initiating the Google OAuth2 authentication process.
        When users access the Google authentication route, this middleware is called to redirect them to Google's authentication page with the specified scopes (email and profile).

    Google Callback Handler (handleGoogleCallback):
        This middleware is executed when Google responds to the authentication request.
        It uses passport.authenticate with the "google" strategy to handle the response.
        It receives information from Google, including any errors (err), the authenticated user (user), and additional information (info).
        If there's an error during authentication, it logs the error and redirects to a failure route.
        If authentication fails (e.g., user denies access), it logs the failure and redirects to a failure route.
        If authentication is successful, it checks if the user exists in your database by querying their Google ID.
        If the user doesn't exist, a new user is created in your database using the provided Google ID and display name.
        The user's information is stored in the user session, allowing you to maintain the user's state.
        If the user already exists in the database, a passport session is opened for them, and their information is stored in the session.
        It logs the relevant user information and redirects to a success route on successful authentication.

    Print User Information (printUserInfo):
        This route allows you to print the user's information to the console.
        It checks if the user is authenticated using req.user.
        If the user is authenticated, it prints the user information and sends it as a JSON response.
        If the user is not authenticated, it sends a 401 response indicating that the user is not authenticated.

    Protected Route Handler (handleProtectedRoute):
        This is similar to printUserInfo but provides a protected route.
        It checks if the user is authenticated using req.user and responds accordingly.

    Logout Handler (handleLogout):
        This route allows users to log out.
        It calls req.logout() to log the user out and sends a "Goodbye!" message.

    Google Authentication Failure Handler (handleGoogleFailure):
        This route is called when Google authentication fails.
        It sends a "Failed to authenticate" message.

These functions work together to handle user authentication, route protection, and related operations, enabling you to secure your routes and manage user sessions. When a user is successfully authenticated, their information is stored in the session for later use. If a user is not authenticated, they are redirected or receive appropriate error responses.
