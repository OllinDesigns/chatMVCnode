To make a GET request in Postman, you generally don't need to pass the access token as a header in the way you would in your application. In Postman, you can typically add authorization information, including tokens, in the "Authorization" tab. Here's how you can do it:

    Open Postman and create a new request.

    In the request settings, go to the "Authorization" tab.

    In the "Type" dropdown, select the type of authorization required. Since you are using Google OAuth, choose "OAuth 2.0" or "Bearer Token," depending on your use case.

    After selecting the "OAuth 2.0" or "Bearer Token" option, Postman will provide fields for you to fill in the required information.

    Fill in the details:
        Token Name: Give your token a name (e.g., "Google OAuth Token").
        Grant Type: Set it to "Authorization Code" or the appropriate type.
        Callback URL: If required, specify the callback URL (e.g., "http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback").
        Auth URL: The URL to Google's OAuth authorization endpoint (e.g., "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth").
        Access Token URL: The URL to Google's token exchange endpoint.
        Client ID: Your Google OAuth client ID.
        Client Secret: Your Google OAuth client secret.
        Scope: Specify the scope of access you need, such as "email" and "profile."

    After you've filled in the details, click "Request Token."

    This will open a web browser window where you can log in to your Google account and authorize Postman to access your account. After authorization, you'll be provided with an access token.

    Copy the access token and click "Use Token."

    Postman will store and automatically include the access token in the request headers for you.

You can then create your GET request and send it to the URL you want to access, such as "http://localhost:8080/api/users." Postman will use the stored access token to make the request.

Remember to adjust the specific details in Postman based on your Google OAuth configuration and the type of token you're using.
