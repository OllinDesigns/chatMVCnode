Ok I like what you propose but I want it to be a little different. First, I don't want to change my sendMessage1 function at all. Instead what we are going to do is create a function called sendMessageToChatroom that implements the same logic as sendMessage1. Thus, to send a message to the chatroom we will have a different route. I give you my current src/controllers/messageController.ts so you have more information

import { Request, Response } from "express";
import Message from "../models/messageModel";
// import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { IUser } from "../models/userModel";
import { getIo } from "../sockets";



export const sendMessage1 = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log("sendMessage1 function is called");
  try {
    const recipientUserId = req.params.userId;
    const { text } = req.body; // Remove author from the destructuring

    const user = req.user as IUser | undefined; // Use IUser and allow undefined

    if (!user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: "User not authenticated" });
    }

    // Create a new message with the authenticated user as the author
    const newMessage = new Message({
      recipientUser: recipientUserId,
      author: user._id, // Automatically set the authenticated user's ID
      text,
    });

    console.log("New message:", newMessage);

    await newMessage.save();

    const io = getIo();

    io.emit("new-message", newMessage);

    return res.status(201).json(newMessage);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending a message:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });
  }
};


export const getMessages = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    // Retrieve all messages from the database
    const messages = await Message.find();

    return res.status(200).json(messages);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error getting messages:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });
  }
};


I want a function that has exactly the same logic and functionality. The only difference in the function I am asking for is the following: I want my new function to store the message in my database in an array. This array must be called chatRoom. chatRoom must be a new collection in the mongoDB database. can you repeat what I want?

You'd like to create a new function with the same logic and functionality as the one you provided earlier. The only difference is that instead of saving messages to the MongoDB "Message" collection, you want to store messages in an array within a new MongoDB collection called "chatRoom." This means you'll need to modify the data storage structure to use an array for the chat messages and create a new MongoDB collection for this purpose. Is that correct?

If that's the case, you will need to make significant changes to the data storage and retrieval aspects of your code to implement this functionality. You'll need to create a new MongoDB collection, set up the schema for chat messages, and modify the function to work with this new collection. If you're ready to proceed with this task, I can provide guidance on how to create the new collection and modify the code.
