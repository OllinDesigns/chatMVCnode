# Chat

Instructions

Let's build a Chat!!!

We will need socket.io, a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It allows real-time two-way communication between clients and web servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser and a server-side library for Node.js.

- Level 1

Create an application that displays a login page where the user can enter a chat room (client and server must be completely separate). By opening the same URL in another browser window, we can log in with another user. Verify that they are in the same room and allow them to chat. Add the ability to create multiple chat rooms and manage persistence with MongoDB (with Mongoose) or MySQL (with Sequelize).

- Level 2

Add authentication using Google Token (google-auth-library)

- Level 3

To overcome this level you can add different options:

     Add any functionality you find useful.
     Add the frontend customization you want.
     Create the frontend with some framework (React, Vue, Angular).
     Make the project using TypeScript.


     User Creation: You mentioned using the userController to create a user. This can be done after successful authentication. The user data can be extracted from the authentication result (e.g., from the Google OAuth profile) and passed to the userController to create a user in your database.

sesion: hacer la sesion con backup storage en el frontend. la session de cookies puede dar problemas

la sesion se usa para autentificar el socket

Ok now my project does a successful login with authentication. Later in this project, I will need to define a session for the user and implement web sockets. I have a passport session at the moment, but I may need to change it later in the project. My application is a chat application, so sockets will allow for two-way communication between client and server. Keep this instruction in mind for further development of the project. For the moment, don't do anything with this


What I need for the moment, is that the user, which is already logged in and authenticated, can send messages to other users of the database. Here I ask for your help, because I don't know if the best thing to do is to make another model "message" or that message is a property of the user model. I need you to guide me. What I want is the simplest option. The messages only need 3 parameters: the id of the user (the id that has been generated with the objectId of mongoDB), the string text and the date of creation of the message. The date must be generated automatically by mongoDB when the message is created. This way we will be able to organize the messages in a chronological way when in a later stage of the project we implement the chat room where the users can interact. We will test this with an HTTP post request in postman. Tell me what I have to do. Tell me if you need files from my project to do this.

Ok, I like what you propose and I am going to implement it. but a question before doing it: should I change my userModel? If this brings benefits to my project purposes I will do it. but attention! The model that you propose (which should be better adapted to the functionality of sending and receiving messages) SHOULD NOT AFFECT AT ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY OF AUTHENTICATING AND ADDING TO THE DATABASE, which works very well at the moment. For this I ask you to take a look at my userModel as well as my src/controllers/authController.ts and src/controllers/userController.ts which are the files responsible for the authentication and creation of the user. I will give you those 3 files, wait for them before giving me any answer

ok this is what we are going to try. I am going to modify my userModel. but first I want you to carefully analyze the files with which I have programmed the authentication. The last thing I want is for authentication to not work as intended. In my current state of the project, a user is created when authenticated with Google and this user is added to the database. If the user already exists and authenticates with Google, the app informs them that they already exist in the database. In both cases a session is opened. my project should do exactly the same after changing my userModel.

Now I will give you my files src/controllers/authController.ts and src/controllers/userController.ts that define authentication and user creation. I will also give you my src/utils/auth.js that defines the passport googlestrategy. Wait for these 3 files before answering. take this time to carefully read what I write to you



the issue could be here:

The user ID you provide in the Postman request URL (/api/messages/:userId) exists in your database, and the user is associated with an active session.

The user receiving the message exists in my database. I am sure of this. But I don't know if the receiving user is associated with an active session. At the moment there is another user (the sender of the message) who is present in the database and who is in an active session, so it could be that the other user, recipient of the message, does not have an active session. Is it possible to send messages to the receiving user (who may not be associated with an active session) so that he receives the message the next time he logs in and authenticates?
ChatGPT

If the recipient user does not have an active session, you can still send messages to them, but they won't receive the messages in real-time. Instead, you would need to implement a system to store the messages for users who are not currently in an active session, and then deliver those messages to the recipients when they log in and authenticate.

Here's a high-level approach to implement message delivery for users who are not in an active session:

    Message Storage: When a user sends a message to another user, store the message in a database or message queue (e.g., MongoDB, Redis, or a dedicated messages table).

    User Status: Track the online status of users in your application. When a user logs in and authenticates, set their status to "online." When they log out or the session expires, set their status to "offline."

    Message Retrieval: Implement a mechanism to check for pending messages for users with the "offline" status when they log in. This could be done as part of the authentication process, where you check for pending messages for the user in the database.

    Message Delivery: When the user logs in and has pending messages, retrieve those messages and deliver them to the user. You can then mark these messages as "read" or "delivered" to avoid delivering them again.

By following this approach, users who are not in an active session will still receive their messages the next time they log in and authenticate.

Here are some considerations for the implementation:

    You may need to structure your database to efficiently store and retrieve messages for users.
    Ensure that the messages are associated with both the sender and the recipient.
    Implement a mechanism for marking messages as "read" to track the message's status.
    During the authentication process, check for pending messages and deliver them to the user's chat interface.

This approach allows you to provide a more complete messaging experience, ensuring that users receive their messages even if they are not in an active session at the time the message is sent.


about send messages:

    /api/messages/:userId (Essential with Session Consideration):

    This route is used to send a message to a specific user.
    You mentioned that it's not working, possibly because the message recipient user does not have an active session. To address this, you can modify the route to handle messages for both authenticated and non-authenticated users. When the recipient user logs in and authenticates, they can retrieve their messages.
